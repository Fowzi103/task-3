Task 3: Data Preprocessing** involves preparing the dataset for analysis or machine learning by cleaning and transforming it into a suitable format. The first step is handling missing values by identifying any null entries and either removing or imputing them. Duplicate records are then dropped to maintain data quality. Next, data types are corrected â€” for instance, converting date fields like 'Posted On' to datetime format. Categorical variables such as 'City' or 'Area Type' are encoded into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding, which allows models to interpret them. In cases where numerical features vary in scale, feature scaling is applied using methods like standardization to bring them to a common scale. Finally, if modeling is part of the next task, the dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate performance later. This step ensures the data is clean, consistent, and machine-learning-ready.
